In this code we are making out own version control system. The first thing you do is initialize a repository and add a file you 
would like stored in it. From there you have a choice between adding another file, removing a file, commiting the directory to The
repository and quitting out of the code. In the add function you are asked to give the name of the file you would like to add and 
if that file is in the directory and doesn't already exist it will be added. The remove function will remove a file from the 
directory. The commit function will take the new files or the changed old files and add them to the repository with their corresponding
version number.
